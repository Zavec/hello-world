Hello whoever is reading this,

  My name is Jesus and im new to programming. I've done alot of things in life but nothing ever really sparked my interest. I took alot of time to try out various things career wise as well as well as wasting time doing nothing. Now 27 years of age I wanted to make a change. Im overwhelmed with all this information about programming that comes my way. But I think finally I have found something to master. Future self, when you are doubting yourself read this. No excuses, No going back, its time to act. I belive in you.
